#Predator
---
Predator is a Post-Apocalyptic Action Platformer with Stat Mechanics. Preaditor right now is in it's Early Indev stages, and will have a release to come out soon. It is also a project for the team _Team Spigot_ at Sno-Isle Tech's Video Game Design class. I, thakyZ, will be maintaining the Github repo even after the project is done with in class, and the team may keep developing it into the summer. Once there is a stable version of the Void Engine, which is linked under [Game Details](#Game Details), I will post a version of this game that is ready to play on this repository's releases page.

Something something Enemies of US band together, send spys to disable US nuclear defences, then nuke US. Things have gone to anarchy prior to nuking, with number of foreign spies and looters/raiders rising massively.
Player character is child, parents trying to protect him. Looters break in, execute parents, and are about to kill child when they see the nuclear flashes, instead opting to dive for the bomb shelters. Meanwhile, kid makes it to sewer. Safe from most radiation, unique gene in his DNA allows him to adapt and take from his enemies DNA, taking on the form of his common food, a rat. Some time later, he resurfaces, hellbent on killing his parents killers, now well stocked and armored marauders. Explains the much more deformed mutants when compared to character.
