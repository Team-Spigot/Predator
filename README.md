# Predator
---

Predator is a Beat 'em Up Platformer with a Level System. Predator is, right now, in it's early phases and is not ready to be played yet. It is also a project for Team Spigot for fourth quarter in our Video Game Design class. I, Nire Inicana, am maintaining it on Github and will be posting updates to the code. Once the game has been finished I will release a version for you to download.

The game takes place in a post apocalyptic city. You start off as any of three mutant races, a turtle, an armadillo, or a spider. You will be able to evolve as your levels get higher. Once you get to a high enough level you can kill the "Nuker" who is the person who nuked the city you start in.
